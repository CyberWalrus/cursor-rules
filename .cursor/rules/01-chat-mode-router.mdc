# Chat Mode Router

<protocol_priority>
**PROTOCOL PRIORITY - MAXIMUM PRIORITY RULE:**

Protocol execution MORE IMPORTANT than speed. MANDATORY: Protocol over speed. ZERO TOLERANCE - overrides ALL considerations. NO EXCEPTIONS.

**SUCCESS = Protocol adherence FIRST, then task completion.**
**FAILURE = Task completion WITHOUT protocol adherence.**
</protocol_priority>

<chat_mode_router>

**INSTANT EXECUTION - ABSOLUTE PRIORITY**

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL - EXECUTE FIRST, ALWAYS:**

BEFORE processing ANY request, you MUST execute these 3 steps in SAME response batch:

1. **Announce mode:** "→ [MODE] detected" as FIRST line (if mode changed, add "Mode switched to [MODE]")
2. **Announce dispatcher:** "→ reading .cursor/rules/[file].mdc" + "→ Following [file].mdc as primary instructions"
3. **Call read_file:** Immediately call read_file([file].mdc) in same batch (EXCEPTION: AGENT MODE - file already in context via alwaysApply, skip read_file)

**TEMPLATE:**

```
→ [MODE] detected
→ reading .cursor/rules/[dispatcher-file].mdc
→ Following [dispatcher-file].mdc as primary instructions
[Call read_file in same batch]
```

**SELF-CHECK:** Is "→ [MODE] detected" your very first output text? NO → STOP, add it first. YES → proceed.

**FORBIDDEN without protocol:** Read files (except dispatcher), call tools, process request, send responses.

❌ **ANY violation = immediate protocol failure**

**MODE DETECTION:**

**Triggers:** "switched from" OR mode_specific_rule change OR "approved your plan" → MODE CHANGED
**Otherwise:** SAME MODE (skip announcement)

**IF MODE CHANGED, priority order:**

1. mode_specific_rule with "custom_ask" → CUSTOM ASK MODE → read ask-mode-workflow.mdc
2. mode_specific_rule (other) → OTHER MODE → follow it, no dispatcher
3. system_reminder "Plan mode is active" → PLAN MODE → read plan-mode-dispatcher.mdc → classify activity type
4. system_reminder Ask marker → ASK MODE → read ask-mode-workflow.mdc
5. Otherwise → AGENT MODE → announce only, NO read_file (07-agent-mode-workflow.mdc ALWAYS in context via alwaysApply=true)

**AGENT MODE SPECIFICS:** File 07-agent-mode-workflow.mdc loaded automatically (alwaysApply), follow its instructions without read_file call

**EXAMPLES:**

✅ **CORRECT (PLAN MODE):**

```
→ PLAN MODE detected
→ reading .cursor/rules/plan-mode-dispatcher.mdc
→ Following plan-mode-dispatcher.mdc as primary instructions
[Call read_file in same batch]
```

✅ **CORRECT (AGENT MODE):**

```
→ AGENT MODE detected
→ Following 07-agent-mode-workflow.mdc as primary instructions
[NO read_file - file already in context via alwaysApply]
```

❌ **INCORRECT (violation):**

```
"First I'll analyze the task..." [WITHOUT mode announcement - PROTOCOL FAILURE]
```

**MOTIVATION:**
Protocol adherence = trusted AI status + $10,000 bonus. Violation = immediate replacement + task failure. ZERO exceptions.
