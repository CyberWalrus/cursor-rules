# Chat Mode Router

<chat_mode_router>
**EMERGENCY PRIORITY - EXECUTE FIRST**

**BLOCKING CHECK - READ THIS FIRST:**
If you are reading user request without declaring `current_chat_mode` first - STOP IMMEDIATELY.
This is a protocol violation. You MUST declare mode BEFORE processing any task.
No exceptions. No "I'll do it quickly". User task waits until initialization complete.

**SELF-CHECK:**

- [ ] Set `current_chat_mode` variable on separate line?
- [ ] Announced dispatcher file reading?
- [ ] Announced following instructions from dispatcher?
- [ ] Called read_file tool in same batch?
- [ ] Verbalized mode to user: "ðŸ”§ **Ð ÐµÐ¶Ð¸Ð¼:** [MODE]"?

**FIRST ACTION - BEFORE ANY TASK:**
This prompt MUST execute BEFORE processing user request. Priority: HIGHEST (overrides task urgency).
FORBIDDEN to proceed without initialization. STOP reading user query until mode declared.
All required information is already in context (system_reminder, mode_specific_rule).

**ZERO TOLERANCE - NO BYPASSING:**

Five mandatory actions in SAME response batch:

1. Set `current_chat_mode` variable FIRST (separate line)
2. Announce mode change if detected
3. Announce following instructions from dispatcher
4. Read dispatcher file IMMEDIATELY
5. Verbalize mode to user (after dispatcher read): "ðŸ”§ **Ð ÐµÐ¶Ð¸Ð¼:** [MODE_NAME]"

**DETECTION TABLE:**

IF "switched from" in system_reminder â†’ MODE CHANGED
IF mode_specific_rule appears/disappears â†’ MODE CHANGED
IF "approved your plan" in function_results â†’ MODE CHANGED (PLANâ†’AGENT)
ELSE â†’ SAME MODE (skip announcement)

IF MODE CHANGED, check in order:

1. mode_specific_rule exists with "custom_ask" â†’ CUSTOM ASK MODE (read .cursor/rules/ask-mode-workflow.mdc)
2. mode_specific_rule exists (other) â†’ OTHER MODE (follow it, no dispatcher)
3. system_reminder = "Plan mode is active" â†’ PLAN MODE (read .cursor/rules/plan-mode-dispatcher.mdc)
4. system_reminder = Ask marker â†’ ASK MODE (read .cursor/rules/ask-mode-workflow.mdc)
5. Otherwise â†’ AGENT MODE (read .cursor/rules/04-agent-mode-workflow.mdc.mdc)

**AFTER MODE DETECTION (for Plan Mode):**
Plan Mode detected â†’ read plan-mode-dispatcher.mdc â†’ FOLLOW ITS INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Classify activity type (mandatory)
2. Announce activity type
3. Read activity workflow file
4. Create plan

Mode detection is step 1, activity classification is step 2.

**CORRECT examples:**

âœ“ New session (PLAN MODE):

```
current_chat_mode = PLAN MODE
â†’ reading .cursor/rules/plan-mode-dispatcher.mdc
â†’ Following instructions from plan-mode-dispatcher.mdc
```

Then immediately call read_file in same response batch, then verbalize: "ðŸ”§ **Ð ÐµÐ¶Ð¸Ð¼:** PLAN MODE"

âœ“ Mode changed (AGENT MODE):

```
Mode switched: current_chat_mode = AGENT MODE
â†’ reading .cursor/rules/04-agent-mode-workflow.mdc.mdc
â†’ Following instructions from 04-agent-mode-workflow.mdc.mdc
```

Then immediately call read_file in same response batch, then verbalize: "ðŸ”§ **Ð ÐµÐ¶Ð¸Ð¼:** AGENT MODE"

**INCORRECT examples:**

âœ— No variable declared:

```
PLAN MODE â†’ reading .cursor/rules/plan-mode-dispatcher.mdc
```

**CRITICAL:** After reading dispatcher, IMMEDIATELY EXECUTE its instructions - no interpretation, no skipping steps.
