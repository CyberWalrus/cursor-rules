# ðŸ“š Rules & Docs Navigator

**Self-Access Rule:** Always prefer reading rules/docs files yourself using read_file tool with absolute paths before asking the user.

**Quick Reference:**

- Rules: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
- Docs: `.cursor/docs/*.md`
- Full catalog: `.cursor/docs/rules-catalog.mdc`

**Usage:** When you need specific rule or doc, read the target file directly rather than asking user for guidance.
