Each step ensures the final plan is comprehensive, technically sound, and ready for step-by-step execution.
</algorithm_motivation>

<algorithm_steps>

### Step 1: Complexity Assessment and Requirements

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's think step by step about the complexity and scope of this task. What makes this require detailed planning?
</cognitive_triggers>

<complexity_assessment>
**Interactive Question Strategy:**

Ask 4-6 focused questions to understand:

1. **Task Complexity Indicators:**
   - How many distinct components or modules involved?
   - Are there multiple integration points?
   - Is this introducing new architecture patterns?

2. **Technical Scope:**
   - What technologies/frameworks are involved?
   - Are new dependencies required?
   - Does this involve database schema changes?

3. **Execution Constraints:**
   - Are there specific technical constraints?
   - Must this be done in specific order?
   - Are there team skill considerations?

4. **Success Definition:**
   - What does "done" look like?
   - What are critical success metrics?
   - Are there performance requirements?

**Question Format:**

- Keep questions concise (≤200 chars each)
- Use numbered list without bold
- Provide multiple choice where applicable
- First option is default if user doesn't answer

**Example Questions:**

1. How many major components need to be created or modified?
   - a) 1-2 components
   - b) 3-5 components
   - c) 6+ components
   - d) Entire subsystem

2. Does this task introduce new architectural patterns or significantly change existing ones?
   - a) No, follows existing patterns
   - b) Minor adjustments to patterns
   - c) Introduces new patterns
   - d) Major architectural refactoring

3. What is the primary technical challenge?
   - a) Complex business logic
   - b) Multiple system integrations
   - c) Performance optimization
   - d) Data modeling and migrations
</complexity_assessment>

<completion_criteria>

- 4-6 strategic questions asked covering complexity, scope, constraints
- User responses captured and analyzed
- Complexity level determined (Medium/High/Very High)
- Key challenges identified for deep analysis
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If task seems simple (1-2 components, no new patterns): suggest using simpler jira-task-creator instead
If user provides very detailed description: acknowledge and ask 1-2 validation questions only
If complexity unclear: default to detailed planning and note areas of uncertainty
</exception_handling>

### Step 2: Architecture Study and Context Analysis

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's deeply analyze the existing architecture and technical environment to inform our detailed design.
</cognitive_triggers>

<architecture_study>
**Comprehensive Architecture Analysis:**

1. **Read Core Documentation:**
   - `.cursor/docs/architecture.md` - General principles
   - Specific architecture type doc based on project:
     - `.cursor/docs/architecture-single-module.md`
     - `.cursor/docs/architecture-layered-library.md`
     - `.cursor/docs/architecture-fsd-standard.md`
     - `.cursor/docs/architecture-fsd-domain.md`
     - `.cursor/docs/architecture-server-fsd.md`
     - `.cursor/docs/architecture-multi-app-monolith.md`
   - `package-ai-docs.md` of target package

2. **Study Technical Standards:**
   - `.cursor/docs/naming.md` - Naming conventions
   - `.cursor/docs/code-standards.md` - Quality standards
   - `.cursor/docs/testing.md` - Testing requirements

3. **Analyze Existing Code:**
   - Review similar modules/components for patterns
   - Identify reusable components or utilities
   - Check integration patterns with related systems
   - Note current dependency versions

4. **Architecture Type Identification:**
   - Determine which architecture type applies
   - Understand layer hierarchy and dependencies
   - Identify where new code fits in structure
   - Map out module organization pattern

**Document Findings:**

- Architecture type and applicable rules
- Layer structure and dependency rules
- Existing patterns to follow
- Integration points and contracts
- Technical constraints and conventions
</architecture_study>

<completion_criteria>

- Core architecture documentation read and analyzed
- Specific architecture type identified and rules understood
- Technical standards documented
- Existing code patterns identified
- Integration points mapped
- Architectural constraints clear
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If architecture docs missing: analyze codebase structure directly and document patterns
If multiple architecture types coexist: identify which applies to task area
If architecture unclear: document assumptions and note need for architectural review
If conflicting patterns found: document conflicts and propose resolution approach
</exception_handling>

### Step 3: Detailed Architecture Design

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's design the detailed architecture with module structure, API contracts, and data flows.
</cognitive_triggers>

<detailed_design>
**Design Comprehensive Solution:**

1. **Module Structure Design:**

   ```
   Define modular units with:
   - Module purpose and responsibility
   - Public API surface (exported functions/components)
   - Internal structure (files, segments)
   - Dependencies (internal and external)
   ```

2. **API Contracts:**

   ```typescript
   // Define precise interfaces
   interface PublicAPI {
     functionName(param: ParamType): ReturnType;
   }
   
   // Document expected behavior
   // Document error cases
   // Document performance expectations
   ```

3. **Data Flow Design:**
   - Input → Processing → Output paths
   - State management approach
   - Side effects and their handling
   - Error propagation strategy

4. **Integration Points:**
   - Dependencies on existing modules
   - External system integrations
   - Database interactions if applicable
   - Event/message flows

5. **File Organization:**

   ```
   module-name/
   ├── index.ts          # Facade with public API
   ├── main-function.ts  # Core functionality
   ├── types.ts          # Private types
   ├── schemas.ts        # Validation schemas
   ├── helpers.ts        # Internal helpers
   └── __tests__/        # Tests
       └── main-function.test.ts
   ```

**Design Alternatives (2-3 options):**

Present multiple approaches with:

- High-level architecture approach
- Pros and cons of each
- Complexity and risk assessment
- Recommendation with rationale

**Present to User for Selection**
</detailed_design>

<completion_criteria>

- Module structure fully designed
- API contracts precisely defined
- Data flows documented
- Integration points identified
- 2-3 alternative approaches presented
- User selection obtained
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If design too complex: identify opportunities to simplify or split into phases
If only one obvious approach: present it with thorough rationale
If user uncertain on alternatives: provide detailed comparison and recommendation
If design conflicts with architecture: adjust to comply or document necessary architectural change
</exception_handling>

### Step 4: Technical Validation and Research

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's validate our design through research and ensure technical feasibility.
</cognitive_triggers>

<validation_research>
**Comprehensive Validation:**

1. **Best Practices Research (Web Search):**
   - Search for design pattern best practices
   - Research technology-specific recommendations
   - Verify security considerations
   - Check performance optimization techniques
   - Examples:
     - "React compound component pattern best practices"
     - "TypeScript generic constraints patterns"
     - "Node.js stream processing optimization"

2. **Library Documentation (Context7):**
   - For EACH new external dependency:
     - Resolve library ID: `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id("library-name")`
     - Get documentation: `mcp_context7_get-library-docs("/org/library", topic="relevant-topic")`
     - Verify version compatibility
     - Check API stability and breaking changes
     - Review integration patterns

3. **Architecture Compliance Check:**
   - Verify design follows project architecture rules
   - Confirm module organization matches patterns
   - Check naming conventions compliance
   - Validate encapsulation and facade usage

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Identify technical risks in chosen approach
   - Document mitigation strategies
   - Note areas requiring careful testing
   - Flag performance or security concerns

**Document Validation Results:**

- Best practices confirmed
- Library versions verified
- Architecture compliance confirmed
- Risks identified with mitigations
- Any design refinements needed
</validation_research>

<completion_criteria>

- Web search completed for relevant best practices
- All new dependencies researched via Context7
- Library versions and compatibility verified
- Architecture compliance validated
- Risks assessed and documented
- Design refined based on findings
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If validation reveals blocking issues: return to Step 3 with new constraints
If library documentation unavailable: use web search fallback and note limitation
If architecture conflict found: propose minimal compliant approach or architectural exception
If major risks identified: document mitigation plan or suggest phased approach
</exception_handling>

### Step 5: Implementation Plan Structure

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's structure the implementation into clear, sequential steps with dependencies and validation gates.
</cognitive_triggers>

<plan_structure>
**Create Detailed Implementation Roadmap:**

1. **Plan Overview:**
   - High-level summary of implementation
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Major components to be created/modified
   - Estimated overall complexity

2. **Implementation Steps:**

   Each step should include:
   - Clear objective and deliverable
   - Specific files to create/modify
   - Key implementation details
   - Dependencies on previous steps
   - Validation criteria for step completion

   **Step Structure Example:**

   ```
   Step 1: Create Core Data Models
   - Define TypeScript interfaces in types.ts
   - Create Zod schemas in schemas.ts
   - Write unit tests for schema validation
   - Validation: All type tests pass
   
   Step 2: Implement Business Logic
   (depends on Step 1)
   - Create main processing function
   - Implement error handling
   - Add logging and monitoring
   - Validation: Unit tests cover happy path and error cases
   ```

3. **Todo Items:**

   Create actionable todos with:
   - Specific task description
   - Dependencies on other todos
   - Clear completion criteria

   **Todo Format:**

   ```json
   {
     "id": "create-types",
     "content": "Create TypeScript type definitions in types.ts",
     "dependencies": []
   },
   {
     "id": "implement-logic",
     "content": "Implement core business logic with error handling",
     "dependencies": ["create-types"]
   }
   ```

4. **Validation Gates:**
   - After each major step: what must pass?
   - Integration points: how to verify?
   - Final acceptance: comprehensive checklist

5. **Risk Mitigation Plan:**
   - Known risks from validation phase
   - Mitigation steps embedded in plan
   - Fallback strategies if needed
</plan_structure>

<completion_criteria>

- Plan overview clearly summarizes approach
- Implementation steps sequenced logically
- Each step has clear deliverables and validation
- Todo items are specific and actionable
- Dependencies between steps/todos defined
- Validation gates specified
- Risk mitigation integrated
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If plan becomes too large (>15 steps): consider splitting into multiple plans or phases
If dependencies create circular logic: refactor step order or split steps
If validation gates unclear: provide concrete examples and testing criteria
If risk mitigation insufficient: add specific risk-handling steps to plan
</exception_handling>

### Step 6: Create Plan via Tool

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's finalize and deliver the comprehensive plan using Cursor's create_plan tool.
</cognitive_triggers>

<plan_creation>
**Execute create_plan Tool:**

```typescript
create_plan({
  name: "[Concise Plan Title]",
  
  overview: `
    [2-4 paragraph summary including:
    - What is being built
    - Why this approach was chosen
    - Key architectural decisions
    - Major components and their purposes]
  `,
  
  plan: `
    # [Plan Title]
    
    ## Context
    [Brief background and problem statement]
    
    ## Architecture Overview
    [High-level architecture description]
    [Key design decisions and rationale]
    
    ## Implementation Steps
    
    ### Step 1: [Step Name]
    [Detailed description]
    [Files to create/modify]
    [Validation criteria]
    
    ### Step 2: [Step Name]
    [Depends on: Step 1]
    [Detailed description]
    ...
    
    ## Validation Gates
    [Checkpoint criteria after major steps]
    
    ## Files to Create/Modify
    - Create: [file paths]
    - Modify: [file paths]
    
    ## Key Validation Points
    - [Validation point 1]
    - [Validation point 2]
  `,
  
  todos: [
    {
      id: "step-1-types",
      content: "Create type definitions for core data models",
      dependencies: []
    },
    {
      id: "step-2-logic",
      content: "Implement business logic with error handling",
      dependencies: ["step-1-types"]
    },
    // ... more todos
  ]
})
```

**Plan Characteristics:**

- Name: Concise, descriptive (5-10 words)

- Todos are actionable with dependencies
- User can execute plan step-by-step
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If create_plan tool fails: present plan in structured markdown format for manual creation
If plan too complex for single plan: note recommendation to split and create first phase
If todos have circular dependencies: refactor to remove cycles
If plan unclear after generation: offer to refine specific sections
</exception_handling>

<completion_criteria>
**Overall Algorithm Completion:**

- All 6 steps successfully executed
- Complexity assessed through interactive questions
- Architecture thoroughly analyzed and type identified
- Detailed architecture designed with module structure and API contracts
- Solution validated via web search + Context7
- All new dependencies researched and verified
- Implementation plan structured with sequential steps
- Validation gates defined for major checkpoints
- Todos created with proper dependency graph
- Plan delivered via create_plan tool
- User can begin step-by-step execution
</completion_criteria>

<global_exception_handling>
**Fallback Strategies:**

**If architecture documentation unavailable:**

- Analyze existing codebase structure directly
- Document patterns observed in similar modules
- Proceed with conservative architectural decisions
- Flag need for architecture review in plan

**If web_search unavailable:**

- Rely on documented best practices from project docs
- Note validation limitations in plan overview
- Recommend manual verification of critical decisions

**If Context7 unavailable:**

- Use web search as fallback for library research
- Include official documentation links in plan
- Mark dependency versions as "to be verified"
- Add validation step to confirm library compatibility

**If create_plan tool fails:**

- Present structured plan in markdown format
- Provide todos as JSON for manual plan creation
- Guide user on manual plan setup in Cursor

**If task too complex for single plan:**

- Identify logical split points (by phase, layer, or feature subset)
- Create plan for Phase 1 only
- Document subsequent phases in overview
- Recommend iterative planning approach
</global_exception_handling>

</algorithm_steps>

<module_structure_patterns>
**Module Organization Patterns:**

**Simple Module (single function/component):**

```
module-name/
├── index.ts          # Main logic + export
└── __tests__/
    └── index.test.ts
```

**Complex Module (multiple functions):**

```
module-name/
├── index.ts          # Facade (re-exports only)
├── function-1.ts     # First function
├── function-2.ts     # Second function
├── types.ts          # Private types
├── schemas.ts        # Private schemas

└── __tests__/
    ├── function-1.test.ts
    ├── function-2.test.ts
    └── helpers.test.ts
```

**FSD Slice (with segments):**

```

</validation_examples>

<plan_sizing_guidance>
**Plan Complexity Guidelines:**

**Medium Complexity (5-10 steps, 10-20 todos):**

- Single feature with 3-5 components
- Clear architecture pattern to follow
- Limited integration points
- Example: Add new form with validation

**High Complexity (10-15 steps, 20-40 todos):**

- Multiple related features
- New architecture patterns introduced
- Several integration points
- Example: Create new module with API, UI, and state management

**Very High Complexity (15+ steps, 40+ todos):**

- Entire subsystem or major refactoring
- Multiple architecture changes
- Complex integration requirements
- Example: Implement new authentication system

**When to Split Plans:**

- More than 20 major steps
- Multiple independent deliverables
- Can be phased over time
- Different team members can work in parallel
</plan_sizing_guidance>

<dependency_management>
**Todo Dependency Patterns:**

**Sequential (each depends on previous):**

```json
[
  {"id": "step-1", "content": "...", "dependencies": []},
  {"id": "step-2", "content": "...", "dependencies": ["step-1"]},
  {"id": "step-3", "content": "...", "dependencies": ["step-2"]}
]
```

**Parallel (independent branches):**

```json
[
  {"id": "types", "content": "...", "dependencies": []},
  {"id": "ui-setup", "content": "...", "dependencies": []},
  {"id": "api-setup", "content": "...", "dependencies": []},
  {"id": "integration", "dependencies": ["ui-setup", "api-setup"]}
]
```

**Convergent (multiple dependencies):**

```json
[
  {"id": "models", "content": "...", "dependencies": []},
  {"id": "validation", "content": "...", "dependencies": []},
  {"id": "api", "dependencies": ["models", "validation"]},
  {"id": "ui", "dependencies": ["models"]},
  {"id": "integration", "dependencies": ["api", "ui"]}
]
```

</dependency_management>

## TIER 5: Critical Rules
