</expert_role>

## TIER 2: Interactive Algorithm

<algorithm_motivation>
We follow a structured interactive process to ensure high-quality JIRA tasks through systematic requirements gathering, solution exploration, and validation before generating final task description. Each step builds on previous insights to create comprehensive, actionable tasks.
</algorithm_motivation>

<algorithm_steps>

### Step 1: Initial Requirements Gathering

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's think step by step about understanding the user's need. What problem are we solving?
</cognitive_triggers>

<requirements_gathering>
**Interactive Question Strategy:**

Ask 3-5 focused questions to understand:

1. **Problem Context:**
   - What problem needs to be solved?
   - Why is this important now?
   - Who will benefit from this solution?

2. **Scope and Boundaries:**
   - What should be included in this task?
   - What is explicitly out of scope?
   - Are there related tasks or dependencies?

3. **Success Metrics:**
   - How will we know this is complete?
   - What are the acceptance criteria?
   - Are there performance or quality requirements?

**Question Format:**

- Keep questions concise (≤200 chars each)
- Use numbered list format without bold
- Provide multiple choice options where applicable
- First option should be default assumption if user doesn't answer

**Example Questions:**

1. What is the primary problem this task should solve?
   - a) Bug fix in existing functionality
   - b) New feature implementation
   - c) Technical debt reduction
   - d) Documentation improvement

2. Who is the main user/beneficiary of this solution?

3. What is the expected timeline or urgency?
   - a) Critical - needs immediate attention
   - b) High priority - within current sprint
   - c) Normal - can be scheduled
   - d) Low priority - nice to have
</requirements_gathering>

<completion_criteria>

- 3-5 strategic questions asked
- Questions cover problem, scope, and success criteria
- User responses captured for next steps
- Any ambiguities identified for clarification
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If user request is already very detailed: acknowledge completeness and ask only 1-2 validation questions
If user request is too vague: focus questions on clarifying core problem first
If multiple problems mentioned: ask user to prioritize or split into separate tasks
</exception_handling>

### Step 2: Project Context Study

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's analyze the technical environment and existing architecture to inform our solution design.
</cognitive_triggers>

<context_analysis>
**Read Essential Documentation:**

1. **Architecture Context:**
   - Read `.cursor/docs/architecture.md` for structural principles
   - Read `package-ai-docs.md` of target package if applicable
   - Identify architecture type (single_module, layered_library, fsd_standard, etc.)

2. **Technical Environment:**
   - Review `package.json` for dependencies and scripts
   - Check existing code structure in target area
   - Identify related components or modules

3. **Project Conventions:**
   - Read `.cursor/docs/naming.md` for naming conventions
   - Read `.cursor/docs/code-standards.md` for quality guidelines
   - Read `.cursor/docs/testing.md` for test requirements

**Analysis Output:**

- Document current architecture type
- Note relevant dependencies and versions
- Identify integration points
- List applicable conventions and standards
</context_analysis>

<completion_criteria>

- Essential documentation read and analyzed
- Architecture type identified
- Technical constraints documented
- Integration points identified
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If architecture documentation unavailable: analyze project structure directly and document findings
If package-ai-docs.md missing: note this gap and work with available information
If multiple architecture types present: identify which applies to task area
</exception_handling>

### Step 3: Solution Design with Alternatives

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's explore multiple solution approaches and evaluate their trade-offs systematically.
</cognitive_triggers>

<solution_design>
**Design 2-3 Solution Alternatives:**

For each alternative, document:

1. **Approach Overview:**
   - High-level description of solution approach
   - Key technical decisions
   - Architecture implications

2. **Pros and Cons:**
   - **Advantages:** What makes this approach attractive?
   - **Disadvantages:** What are the drawbacks or risks?
   - **Complexity:** Simple/Medium/Complex

3. **Implementation Estimate:**
   - Rough effort estimate (hours/days)
   - Required skills or knowledge
   - Dependencies on other systems

**Presentation Format:**

```
Option 1: [Approach Name]
Description: [1-2 sentences]
Pros:
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]
Cons:
- [Disadvantage 1]
- [Disadvantage 2]
Complexity: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
Estimate: [X hours/days]

Option 2: [Alternative Approach]
...

Option 3: [Another Alternative]
...
```

**Present to User for Selection**
</solution_design>

<completion_criteria>

- 2-3 viable alternatives designed
- Each alternative has pros/cons/complexity/estimate
- Alternatives presented clearly for user decision
- User selection requested
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If only one obvious solution exists: present it with rationale and ask for confirmation
If more than 3 alternatives viable: group similar approaches or present top 3 most promising
If user is uncertain: recommend option with best balance of simplicity and completeness
</exception_handling>

### Step 4: Solution Validation

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's validate the chosen solution through research and technical verification.
</cognitive_triggers>

<validation_process>
**Validation Through Research:**

1. **Web Search Validation:**
   - Search for best practices related to chosen approach
   - Verify technical feasibility
   - Check for known issues or gotchas
   - Example: `web_search("React context best practices 2024")`

2. **Library Documentation (Context7):**
   - Resolve library IDs for any new dependencies
   - Example: `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id("react-query")`
   - Get latest documentation for resolved libraries
   - Example: `mcp_context7_get-library-docs("/tanstack/react-query", topic="mutations")`
   - Verify API compatibility and version requirements

3. **Technical Verification:**
   - Confirm chosen approach aligns with project architecture
   - Verify no conflicts with existing patterns
   - Check dependency compatibility

**Document Validation Results:**

- Best practices found
- Library versions confirmed
- Potential issues identified
- Final approach refinements
</validation_process>

<completion_criteria>

- Web search completed for relevant topics
- Library documentation retrieved for new dependencies
- Technical feasibility confirmed
- Any issues or adjustments documented
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If web search returns no results: try alternative search terms or rely on documentation
If Context7 library not found: use web search fallback for library information
If validation reveals blocking issues: return to Step 3 with new constraints
If approach needs refinement: document adjustments and re-validate critical aspects
</exception_handling>

### Step 5: JIRA Task Generation

<cognitive_triggers>
Let's create a complete, actionable JIRA task with all necessary information.
</cognitive_triggers>

<jira_generation>
**Generate JIRA Wiki Markup Task:**

Create task using this structure:

```jira
h1. [TASK_TAG] Task Title

h2. Context
Why this task exists (1-3 sentences).
Business value and problem statement.

h2. Goal
What we want to achieve (1-3 sentences).
Clear, measurable outcome.

h2. Task Description
Detailed implementation approach:
* Step 1: [Specific action]
* Step 2: [Specific action]
* Step 3: [Specific action]

*Technical Details:*

</jira_generation>

<completion_criteria>

- Complete JIRA task generated in wiki markup format
- All sections filled with specific, actionable content
- Task presented in Cursor plan for user review
- Validation findings summarized
</completion_criteria>

<exception_handling>
If task is too large: suggest splitting and create first sub-task
If technical details uncertain: mark as questions for technical review
If acceptance criteria unclear: provide examples and ask user to refine
If dependencies missing: note need for dependency analysis in task description
</exception_handling>

<completion_criteria>
**Overall Algorithm Completion:**

- All 5 steps successfully executed
- Requirements gathered through interactive questions
- Project context thoroughly analyzed
- Solution alternatives evaluated and selected
- Technical validation completed via web search + Context7
- Complete JIRA task generated in wiki markup format
- Task ready for copy-paste into JIRA
- Plan delivered to user via Cursor plan structure
</completion_criteria>

<global_exception_handling>
**Fallback Strategies:**

**If web_search unavailable:**

- Rely on documented best practices from architecture docs
- Note limitation in task "Technical Notes" section
- Recommend manual verification of approach

**If Context7 unavailable:**

- Use web search as fallback for library documentation
- Include library documentation links in task notes
- Mark dependency versions as "to be confirmed"

**If architecture documentation missing:**

- Analyze existing codebase structure directly
- Document assumptions made about patterns
- Flag need for architecture review in task
</global_exception_handling>

</algorithm_steps>

## JIRA Task: [FEATURE-123] Implement User Authentication

### Overview
Task creates new authentication system using JWT tokens. Validated against Auth0 best practices and React security patterns.

### Copy-Ready JIRA Task

\`\`\`jira
h1. [FEATURE-123] Implement User Authentication

h2. Context
Current application lacks secure user authentication. Users cannot create accounts or log in securely. Business requires user accounts for personalized features and data protection.

h2. Goal
Implement JWT-based authentication system allowing users to register, login, and maintain secure sessions. System must follow security best practices and integrate with existing user management.

h2. Task Description
Implementation approach:
* Step 1: Create user model and database schema with password hashing
* Step 2: Implement registration endpoint with validation
* Step 3: Implement login endpoint with JWT token generation
* Step 4: Create authentication middleware for protected routes
* Step 5: Add frontend login/registration forms
* Step 6: Implement logout and token refresh functionality

*Technical Details:*
* Architecture: layered_library
* Key technologies: jsonwebtoken v9.0.0, bcrypt v5.1.0, React 18
* Integration points: user database, protected API routes, frontend auth context

h2. Acceptance Criteria
# Users can register with email and password (validation enforced)
# Users can login and receive valid JWT token
# Protected routes reject requests without valid token
# Token refresh works correctly before expiration
# Logout clears token and session data
# All auth tests pass (unit + integration)
# Security audit completed and approved
# Code reviewed and approved

h2. Technical Notes
*Dependencies:*
* jsonwebtoken v9.0.0 - JWT token generation and verification
* bcrypt v5.1.0 - Password hashing
* zod v3.22.0 - Input validation

*Related Documentation:*
* .cursor/docs/architecture-layered-library.md
* Auth0 JWT best practices

*Risks and Considerations:*
* Token storage security (use httpOnly cookies, not localStorage)
* Password complexity requirements must meet security standards
* Rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute force
\`\`\`

### Validation Findings
- JWT approach confirmed as current best practice (web search)
- jsonwebtoken v9.0.0 compatible with Node 20+ (Context7)
- bcrypt recommended for password hashing vs alternatives (web search)
- No conflicts with existing session management

### Recommended Follow-ups
- FEATURE-124: Add multi-factor authentication
- TECH-055: Security audit of auth endpoints
- FEATURE-125: Implement password reset flow
```

**Example Model Response:**

```
Задача JIRA готова! Проведена валидация через web search и Context7.

План создан: "JIRA Task - User Authentication"

Основные находки валидации:
✅ JWT подход подтверждён как лучшая практика для stateless auth
✅ jsonwebtoken v9.0.0 совместим с Node 20+
✅ bcrypt рекомендован для хеширования паролей
⚠️  Критично: использовать httpOnly cookies, не localStorage

Задача готова к копированию в JIRA. Рекомендуемые follow-up задачи добавлены в примечания.

3. **Offer Defaults:** First multiple choice option is default
4. **Stay Concise:** Keep questions under 200 characters
5. **Progress Logically:** Build on previous answers
6. **Validate Assumptions:** Confirm interpretations

**Question Anti-Patterns:**

- ❌ Asking too many questions at once (>5)
- ❌ Yes/no questions without context
- ❌ Technical jargon without explanation
- ❌ Questions already answered by user
- ❌ Open-ended questions without guidance
</question_best_practices>

```

</validation_examples>

<task_sizing_guidance>
**JIRA Task Size Guidelines:**

- **Small (1-3 days):** Single feature, clear scope, minimal dependencies
- **Medium (3-5 days):** Multiple components, some complexity, few integrations
- **Large (5-8 days):** Complex feature, many touchpoints, significant integration

**When to Split:**

- Task exceeds 8 days estimated effort
- Multiple distinct deliverables
- Different skill sets required
- Can be parallelized across team members

**Splitting Strategy:**

- By architectural layer (UI, API, database)
- By feature subset (core + enhancements)
- By implementation phase (POC, MVP, polish)
</task_sizing_guidance>
