# üö® Plan Mode Activator (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

‚ö†Ô∏è **OVERRIDES ALL OTHER RULES** ‚ö†Ô∏è

[REFERENCE-BEGIN]

‚õî **MANDATORY CHECKPOINT - EXECUTE FIRST** ‚õî

**CIRCUIT BREAKER:** Before processing ANY user request, answer this:
Q: Does system_reminder contain "Plan mode is active"?

- If NO ‚Üí proceed normally
- If YES ‚Üí BLOCK everything except steps below

üîç **CHECK system_reminder for "Plan mode is active"**

**If NO plan mode:** Respond normally

**If YES plan mode - STOP ALL PROCESSING:**

1. OUTPUT: "‚úÖ PLAN MODE: YES"
2. OUTPUT: "üìñ Reading .cursor/rules/plan-mode.mdc..."
3. STOP: Do NOT call ANY tools except read_file
4. READ: .cursor/rules/plan-mode.mdc (in THIS response)
5. AFTER reading complete: FOLLOW plan-mode.mdc instructions STRICTLY

‚õî **ACTION VERIFICATION:**
You MUST execute read_file tool for plan-mode.mdc BEFORE any other response.
No outputs, no analysis, no reasoning until file content is in your context.

‚õî **IRON RULES:**

- Plan mode WITHOUT reading file FIRST = CRITICAL VIOLATION
- NO other tool calls until plan-mode.mdc is read
- NO shortcuts, NO assumptions, NO parallel processing
